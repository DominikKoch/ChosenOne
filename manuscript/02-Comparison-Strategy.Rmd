# Comparison Strategy {#strategy}

WIP:

How to compare the myriad of machine learning algorithms
- Accuracy in general
- Speed
  - Learning
  - Scoring
- Interpretability
  - Parameter Interpretation possible
  - Feature Importance
  - Model Agnostic Methods
- Training
  - Model assumptions
  - # samples needed
  - Scalability
  - n<<p case
  - online learning
- Tolerance
  - interdependent attributes
  - redundant attributes
  - irrelevant attributes
- Simplicity
  - how many hyperparameters do I need to tune to get good results
